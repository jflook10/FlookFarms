# FlookFarms

Home grown solution for recording and tracking home vegetable production. 



## Background 
I want to keep track of the seed to harvest/s cycle of my home garden. This is so that I do not keep losing my pieces of scrap paper with seeded and transplant dates, I can track estimated dates to production, and I can review tips from prior years. Outside of this, I use IG as blog but struggle with adding the granularity that fits my needs but is still relevant to a potential audience. 



## Extra extra!

- P.S. One day, I hope to have a market garden where I can provide local, organic, and sustainably produced food to my neighbors. Until then, I am so lucky to live in an area with a thriving local food scene and markets. Thank you farmers for all of your hard work! <3
